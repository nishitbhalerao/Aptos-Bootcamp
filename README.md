# Crowdfunding Module (Move on Aptos)

This module implements a **basic crowdfunding system** on the Aptos blockchain using the Move programming language.
It allows project owners to create crowdfunding projects with funding goals and lets contributors support them with Aptos tokens.

## üìå Features

* **Create Project**: A project owner can start a crowdfunding project with a funding goal.
* **Contribute**: Users can contribute Aptos tokens (`AptosCoin`) to support a project.

    }

    public fun create_project(owner: &signer, goal: u64) { ... }
    public fun contribute_to_project(contributor: &signer, project_owner: address, amount: u64) { ... }
